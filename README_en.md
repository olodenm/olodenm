Analysis of HR department data (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy.stats, sklearn).

<b>Task</b>:
Exploratory data analysis of the HR department, including calculation of statistics, visualization of correlations, hypothesis testing, and building an LDA model to predict attrition.

<b>Result<b>:
Found that salary level does not influence employee attrition, built an LDA model predicting employee attrition based on available factors.</li>

The first part of the code analyzes the preference of critics for sports games, compares critics' preferences between PC and PS4 games, and evaluates critics' preference for shooters and strategies based on statistical tests and analysis of ratings data.

The second part implements a basic logistic regression model for classifying text messages as spam or not spam, including text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, model training, evaluation of its accuracy on test data, and analysis of misclassified messages.</li>
